## 1. Creating the JSON file

Firstly, you need to go to the [is-a-dev/register](https://wdh.gg/F2Q7VeE) repository on GitHub.

If you don't have a GitHub account, you can create one by clicking `Sign Up`.

Navigate to the [`domains/`](https://wdh.gg/borLkD3) folder and then from there click the `Add file` button and selecting the `Create new file option`.

If it says you need to fork the repository, click the fork repository button and continue with the next steps on your forked repository.

Next, add the file name near the top where it says `Name your file...`. Name your file the name of the subdomain you want, in my case I want `william.is-a.dev`, so I will name the file `william.json`.

Here are the naming requirements:

- It must be more than 2 characters long but less than 64 characters
- It cannot contain underscores, only dashes are permitted
- You can only use standard English characters

After naming your file you need to put the JSON content into it, here is an example JSON structure:

```json
{
    "owner": {
        "username": "your-github-username"
    },
    "records": {
        "RECORDTYPE": "RECORDCONTENT"
    }
}
```

- Replace `your-github-username` with your GitHub username.
- For `RECORDTYPE` set it to what you require for your use. You can see the records is-a.dev supports [here](https://wdh.gg/r5LHCLQ). If your website is using GitHub Pages, set this to `CNAME`.
- For `RECORDCONTENT` set this to the value of the record you need, for GitHub Pages this would be `your-github-username.github.io`. (`A`, `AAAA` and `MX` records **must** be an array `[]`.)

**MAKE SURE YOU MODIFY `RECORDTYPE` AND `RECORDCONTENT` TO MATCH THE DNS RECORD YOU REQUIRE.**

Finally, click `Commit changes...` and then `Propose changes`.

## 2. Creating your pull request

Now you should be greeted with a screen which looks like this:

All you need to do here is fill out the requirements and place an `x` between the `[ ]` (so it looks like `[x]`) for each requirement you meet. Please make sure you meet all the requirements before creating the pull request.

Once you have filled out the requirements you can then click the `Create pull request` button and you're done!

## 3. Waiting...

Since you have created your pull request, you will need to wait for a maintainer to merge it before you domain name becomes active. Make sure to keep an eye on your pull request incase one of the maintainers requests changes.

**_Your pull request will normally be merged with-in 24-48 hours, however in some cases it may take longer. Please be patient as the maintainers are very busy._**

Once your pull request is merged you should be good to go! [Open an issue](https://wdh.gg/r1Xw34w) if you run into any trouble.

Congratulations you have successfully setup your free is-a.dev subdomain!

_Make sure to join the is-a.dev [Discord server](https://wdh.gg/WxDO6wi) for announcements regarding the service._
